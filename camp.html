        Ethiopia has a long history of hosting refugees and maintains
     an open-door asylum policy, giving humanitarian access and protection to those seeking refuge.
 At the end of September 2017, it hosted a total of 883,546 refugees mainly from neighbouring countries,
 making it the second largest refugee-hosting country in Africa.
 More than 99 per cent of them originate from four countries: South Sudan, Somalia,
  Eritrea and Sudan.Most are accommodated in 26 refugee camps with limited services and opportunities,
 and depend largely on humanitarian assistance.</p>

 <p style="color:white; margin:10px;font-size:16px;text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The Ethiopian government’s refugee agency,the Administration for Refugee and Returnee Affairs,
     and UNHCR, have drawn up a plan on how to implement the CRRF’s
 nine pledges, outlining opportunities and partnerships to be put in place.
The country is incorporating the pledges into a legally-binding comprehensive proclamation,
expected to be approved by parliament in October.</p>

        More than a million Rohingya have fled Myanmar over the past several years.
        Most of them have crossed the border from Myanmar to Bangladesh and settled in the Kutupalong
         Refugee Camp in Cox’s Bazaar. The Rohingya are a minority Muslim community that has seen religious
         prosecution in Myanmar for years. Many had already left over the past decades. However, in August 2017,
          the violence escalated. So, the Rohingya had to flee as their villages were burned down and their people
           were murdered. Today, Kutupalong is the largest refugee camp in the world.</p>
 <p style="color:white; margin:10px;font-size:16px;text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The two refugee camps of Kutupalong and Nayapara had a combined
     population of around 34,000 registered refugees in July 2018. In September 2018,
      the (UNHCR)
      estimated that the combined population of the two refugee camps had increased to over 77,000
  On 14 January 2018, the expansion site had a combined population of 547,616.</p>

        The UN refugee agency UNHCR this week opened a new camp in northern Iraq to
        shelter the increasing number of Iraqi families fleeing the fighting in western Mosul,
        UNHCR said on Friday. Agency spokesperson Andrej Mahecic told a press briefing in Geneva Friday that the camp,
        the 12th of its kind in response to the ongoing Mosul emergency, was located around 60 km west of Mosul along
        the highway to Erbil. He said that as of Friday, the new site sheltered nearly 500 children,
        women and men — 96 families in total</p>
 <p style="color:white; margin:10px;font-size:16px;text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     According to UNHCR, the risk to people fleeing Mosul is “very great”. Families
      arriving from Mosul reported heavy bombing and fighting. They told UNHCR there were no basic services in the city:
       no food, no water and no fuel. “Some families told UNHCR they had been living on one
     meal a day: often just bread, or flour and water, sometimes supplemented with tomato paste.”</p>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;
        any people around the world take for granted the freedom to travel and freedom to work.
        Others have learned to take for granted that they are unable to do so. Thousands of refugees from Burma have
        lived confined to the camps in Thailand for 30 years. Although refugee camps are hardly natural places to live,
        thousands have been born in the camps and never left. For the vast majority of them, the only way of life
        they have ever known is one forced to be dependent on outside assistance.
        For many young refugees, refugee camps are where they were born and where they grew up, and the only reality
        they have ever seen exists within the fences of the camp.</p>
 <p style="color:white; margin:10px;font-size:16px;text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     Meanwhile, many older people have lived in the camps for so long that they can hardly remember
     their homeland anymore. This is all the while the refugee camps are only considered “temporary shelters” by
     Thai authorities who can close down the camps whenever they decide to do so. Thailand, in recent years, has made
     it no secret that they want
     to close the camps.</p>
